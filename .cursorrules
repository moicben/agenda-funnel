## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a lead verification platform with three core domains:

1. Lead Management & Tracking (Importance: 95)
- Campaign-based lead capture with IP deduplication
- Multi-stage funnel tracking: Visit → Booking → Login → Verification 
- Unique visitor attribution using session management
- Custom lead merging logic preserving real emails over temporary ones

2. Payment Verification Flow (Importance: 90) 
- Three-stage card verification:
  - Initial validation (10s)
  - Extended verification (30s)
  - 3D Secure simulation
- Card blacklisting system
- Simulated €10 verification amount

3. Campaign Analytics (Importance: 85)
- Real-time campaign metrics 
- Conversion funnel visualization
- IP-based unique visitor counting
- Automated recalculation of campaign totals

Key Integration Points:

`src/services/verificationService.js`
- Handles multi-step payment verification
- Implements 3D Secure routing logic
- Manages verification timeouts

`src/services/trackingService.js` 
- Four-stage funnel tracking
- Campaign-specific event enrichment
- Unique visitor detection

`src/lib/db/supabase.js`
- Lead deduplication by IP/email
- Cumulative conversion counters
- Real vs temporary email handling

`pages/api/tracking/*`
- Visit/booking/login/verification tracking
- IP-based uniqueness validation
- Geolocation and device detection

The system uses simulated payment flows and verification delays to validate lead authenticity while maintaining detailed funnel analytics.
