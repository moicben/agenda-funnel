# verification-flow

The verification flow implements a multi-stage payment verification system:

### Core Verification Stages
1. Initial Card Validation (10s)
- Validates basic card details format and blacklist status
- Performs preliminary authorization check
- Implements cool-down period between attempts

2. Extended Verification (30s) 
- Deep validation of card authenticity
- Risk scoring based on card details
- Session-based verification tracking

3. 3D Secure Simulation
- Simulated bank verification screen
- OTP/code entry simulation 
- Success/failure state management

### Key Components

**Card Validation Logic** (src/services/verificationService.js)
- Real-time card number format validation
- Card type detection and logo display
- Blacklist checking against previously verified cards
- Simulated â‚¬10 verification amount

**State Management** (src/services/paymentService.js)
- Tracks verification progress across stages
- Handles timeout scenarios
- Manages verification retry attempts
- Preserves verification state between sessions

**3D Secure Flow** (src/components/payment/ThreeDSecurePopup.js)
- Bank selection interface
- Authentication code simulation
- Loading states between verification steps
- Error handling for failed verifications

**Verification Tracking** (src/hooks/useCardForm.js)
- Logs verification attempts
- Tracks success/failure rates
- Records verification timestamps
- Associates verifications with campaigns

### Critical Paths
```
src/services/verificationService.js
src/services/paymentService.js 
src/components/payment/ThreeDSecurePopup.js
src/components/payment/PaymentForm.js
src/hooks/useCardForm.js
```
