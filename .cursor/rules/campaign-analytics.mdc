## Core Analytics Components

### Visit Tracking
- Unique visitor identification via IP + session ID combination
- 24-hour session duration with automatic expiration
- Device/browser fingerprinting for visitor segmentation
- Geolocation enrichment using visitor IP

### Conversion Tracking
Four-stage funnel measurement:
1. Initial Visit
2. Form Submit/Contact 
3. Login Attempt 
4. Payment Verification

Conversion rates calculated between each stage:
- Visit → Contact Rate
- Contact → Login Rate  
- Login → Verification Rate
- Overall Funnel Conversion

### Lead Deduplication
- Primary key: IP address + campaign ID
- Merging logic for duplicate leads:
  - Retains oldest lead record
  - Aggregates activity counters
  - Preserves non-temporary email addresses
  - Maintains most recent dates

### Campaign Totals
Recalculation process:
1. Unique IP counting per action type
2. Aggregation across all campaigns
3. Cross-verification against lead records
4. Update campaign summary statistics
